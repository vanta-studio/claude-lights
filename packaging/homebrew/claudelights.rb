  caveats <<~EOS
    Open ClaudeLights once and click "Install Hooks" to connect it to
    Claude Code (it adds hook entries to ~/.claude/settings.json; a backup
    is kept). Restart any running Claude Code sessions afterwards.

    Before uninstalling for good, click "Uninstall…" under Settings →
    Claude Code Hooks to remove those entries. If you forget, the leftover
    hooks are harmless no-ops (each entry checks that the helper binary
    still exists), but they stay in settings.json until removed manually.
